  <p class="biopara">I studied English and some computer science during my undergraduate days,
    but upon graduating, I decided to make my living as a copy editor and proofreader.
    While these two disciplines are of course very different (typos can be more
    devastating in code, for example), I like to think that I will retain
    some amount of my ability to catch mistakes in my new field.
  </p>
  <p class="biopara"> In the past year, I began working as a nursing assistant, having
    considered a career in healthcare. While I have decided against pursuing that idea
    any further, I've been glad to have the chance to work on my feet again, as strange
    as that may sound.
  </p>
  <p class="biopara"> In my spare time, I enjoy reading, sketching with pen, and running.</p>
  <p class="biopara"> Some works I've been digging lately:
    <div class=>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYwC3ZC61GE">The Beths' "Knees Deep"</a>
    </div>
    <div class=>
      <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43991/kubla-khan">Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Kubla Khan"</a>
